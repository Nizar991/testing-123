# Toast and Count Mobile App

## Overview
This is a basic mobile application developed using **Android Studio** with **Java** and **XML**. The app provides two main functionalities: displaying a toast message and counting clicks with a dynamic counter display.

## Features
- **Toast Message**:
  - A button labeled **Toast** that, when clicked, displays a short pop-up message (Toast) on the screen.

- **Count Functionality**:
  - A **Count** button that increments a counter starting from `0`.
  - The current count value is displayed in a dedicated **TextView**, updating each time the Count button is clicked.

## Project Structure
- **Android Studio**: Used as the primary IDE for development and testing.
- **Java/XML**: Java handles the appâ€™s logic and functionality, while XML is used to design the user interface.

## How to Use
1. Launch the app on your mobile device.
2. Click the **Toast** button to see a pop-up message displayed on the screen.
3. Click the **Count** button to increment the counter shown in the TextView.
4. Each click increases the count value displayed, starting from `0`.

## Future Enhancements
- Adding a **Reset** button to set the counter back to `0`.
- Allowing customization of the Toast message content and duration.
- Implementing a feature to decrease the count value when needed.
